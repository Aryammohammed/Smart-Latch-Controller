# Smart-Latch-Controller
A button turns the system on. A motion sensor keeps it running. If no movement is detected for 30 seconds, it turns off automatically. An LED shows if it‚Äôs on.
# Soft-Latching-Power-System-With-Motion-Sensor

## üìò Project Overview
This project showcases a smart power control system using an Arduino Uno, a PIR motion sensor, and a soft-latching technique. The system turns on with a button press, stays active as long as motion is detected, and automatically powers off after 30 seconds of inactivity. An LED indicates when the system is running. Ideal for energy-efficient applications like smart lighting or battery-powered devices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. When the button is pressed, the system powers on.
2. Motion resets the shutdown timer.
3. If no motion is detected for 30 seconds, the system shuts off.
4. LED indicates the current system status.
